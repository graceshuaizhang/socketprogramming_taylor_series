I simulated the Paxos algorithm using UDP to choose a value between node.

The Proposer.cpp is compiled to a program named Proposer that implements the agents Proposer.
When run the Proposer program, it will read all proposers' ip and port from a txt file, the filename is passed
as the first argument of the program. The first of the txt file is the number of proposers, and consecutive lines
are the ip address and port seperated by whitespace.
